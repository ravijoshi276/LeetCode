# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by problem type (Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, etc.). Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or contribute.

## Categories:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- Linked Lists
- Recursion

## Problem Solving Strategy:
I aim to solve each problem efficiently. The process typically involves:
1. Understanding the problem and identifying edge cases.
2. Starting with a brute force approach, if necessary.
3. Optimizing the solution using appropriate algorithms or data structures.

## How to Use:
- Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/ravijoshi276/LeetCode/tree/main/leetcode-solutions`.

- Navigate to the relevant folder and open the solution in the respective programming language.

- You can copy and paste the solution code in leetcode problem.
- Also leetcode link to each problem is provided you can go and check it out on your own.
- Almost all solution are optimal. If not optimal will be updated to an optimal solution as soon as i crack it.
